          <h2>Led Zeppelin</h2>
          <p>Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of vocalist Robert
            Plant, guitarist
            Jimmy Page, bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham. With their heavy, guitar-driven
            sound, they
            are regularly cited as one of the progenitors of heavy metal, although their style drew from a variety of
            influences,
            including blues and folk music. The band have been credited with majorly impacting the nature of the music
            industry,
            particularly in the development of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. Many critics consider Led
            Zeppelin one
            of the most successful, innovative, and influential rock groups in history.</p>
          <p>After changing their name from the New Yardbirds, Led Zeppelin signed a deal with Atlantic Records that
            afforded them
            considerable artistic freedom. Although the group were initially unpopular with critics, they achieved
            significant
            commercial success with eight studio albums released over ten years, from Led Zeppelin (1969) to In Through
            the Out Door
            (1979). Their untitled fourth studio album, commonly known as Led Zeppelin IV (1971), became one of the
            best-selling
            albums in history. It featured the song "Stairway to Heaven", which has come to be among the most popular
            and
            influential works in rock music, and helped to secure the group's popularity.</p>
          <p>Page wrote most of Led Zeppelin's music, particularly early in their career, while Plant generally supplied
            the lyrics.
            Jones's keyboard-based compositions later became central to the group's catalogue, which featured increasing
            experimentation. The latter half of their career saw a series of record-breaking tours that earned the group
            a
            reputation for excess and debauchery. Although they remained commercially and critically successful, their
            output and
            touring schedule were limited during the late 1970s, and the group disbanded following Bonham's death from
            alcohol-related asphyxia in 1980. In the decades that followed, the former members sporadically collaborated
            and
            participated in one-off Led Zeppelin reunions. The most successful of these was the 2007 Ahmet Ertegun
            Tribute
            Concert
            in London, with Bonham's son Jason Bonham on drums.</p>
          <p>Led Zeppelin are one of the best-selling music artists of all time; various sources estimate the group's
            record sales at
            200 to 300 million units worldwide. With RIAA-certified sales of 111.5 million units, they are the
            third-best-selling
            band and fifth-best-selling act in the US. They achieved eight consecutive UK number-one albums, and each of
            their nine
            studio albums placed in the top 10 of the Billboard album chart and six reached the number-one spot. Rolling
            Stone
            magazine described them as "the heaviest band of all time", "the biggest band of the Seventies", and
            "unquestionably one
            of the most enduring bands in rock history". They were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995;
            the
            museum's biography of the band states that they were "as influential" during the 1970s as the Beatles were
            during the
            1960s.</p>

            <h3>Formation</h3>
            <p>In 1966, London-based session guitarist Jimmy Page joined the blues-influenced rock band the Yardbirds to
              replace bassist Paul Samwell-Smith. Page soon switched from bass to lead guitar, creating a dual lead
              guitar line-up with Jeff
              Beck. Following Beck's departure in October 1966, the Yardbirds, tired from constant touring and
              recording, began to
              wind down. Page wanted to form a supergroup with Beck and him on guitars, and the Who's Keith Moon and
              John Entwistle
              on drums and bass, respectively. Vocalists Steve Winwood and Steve Marriott were also considered for the
              project.
              The group never formed, although Page, Beck, and Moon did record a song together in 1966, "Beck's Bolero",
              in a session
              that also included bassist-keyboardist John Paul Jones.</p>
            <p>The Yardbirds played their final gig in July 1968 at Luton College of Technology in Bedfordshire. They
              were still committed to several concerts in Scandinavia, so drummer Jim McCarty and vocalist Keith Relf
              authorised Page and bassist Chris Dreja to use the Yardbirds' name to fulfill the band's obligations. Page
              and Dreja began putting a new line-up together. Page's first choice for the lead singer was Terry Reid,
              but Reid declined the offer and suggested Robert Plant, a singer for the Band of Joy and Hobbstweedle.
              Plant eventually accepted the position, recommending former Band of Joy drummer John Bonham. John Paul
              Jones enquired about the vacant position of bass guitarist, at the suggestion of his wife, after Dreja
              dropped out of the project to become a photographer. Page had known Jones since they were both session
              musicians, and agreed to let him join as the final member.</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/newyardbirds.jpg" alt="newyards">
            </div>
            <p>In August 1968, the four played together for the first time in a room below a record store on Gerrard
              Street in
              London. Page suggested that they attempt "Train Kept A-Rollin'", originally a jump blues song popularised
              in a
              rockabilly version by Johnny Burnette, which had been covered by the Yardbirds. "As soon as I heard John
              Bonham play",
              Jones recalled, "I knew this was going to be great ... We locked together as a team immediately". Before
              leaving for
              Scandinavia, the group took part in a recording session for the P. J. Proby album Three Week Hero. The
              album's track
              "Jim's Blues", with Plant on harmonica, was the first studio track to feature all four future members of
              Led
              Zeppelin.</p>
            <p>The band completed the Scandinavian tour as the New Yardbirds, playing together for the first time in
              front of a live
              audience at Gladsaxe Teen Clubs in Gladsaxe, Denmark, on 7 September 1968. Later that month, they began
              recording
              their first album, which was based on their live set. The album was recorded and mixed in nine days, and
              Page covered
              the costs. After the album's completion, the band were forced to change their name after Dreja issued a
              cease and
              desist letter, stating that Page was allowed to use the New Yardbirds moniker for the Scandinavian dates
              only. One
              account of how the new band's name was chosen held that Moon and Entwistle had suggested that a supergroup
              with Page and
              Beck would go down like a "lead balloon", an idiom for disastrous results. The group dropped the 'a' in
              lead at the
              suggestion of their manager, Peter Grant, so that those unfamiliar with the term would not pronounce it
              "leed". The
              word "balloon" was replaced by "zeppelin", a word which, according to music journalist Keith Shadwick,
              brought "the
              perfect combination of heavy and light, combustibility and grace" to Page's mind.</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/Hindenburg_disaster.jpg" alt="zeppelin">
            </div>
            <p>Grant secured a $143,000 advance contract ($1,051,000 today) from Atlantic Records in November 1968—at
              the time, the
              biggest deal of its kind for a new band. Atlantic was a label with a catalogue of mainly blues, soul, and
              jazz
              artists, but in the late 1960s it began to take an interest in British progressive rock acts. Record
              executives signed
              Led Zeppelin without having ever seen them. Under the terms of their contract, the band had autonomy in
              deciding
              when they would release albums and tour, and had the final say over the contents and design of each album.
              They would
              also decide how to promote each release and which tracks to release as singles. They formed their own
              company,
              Superhype, to handle all publishing rights.</p>
            <h3>Early Years: 1968 - 1970</h3>
            <p>The band began their first tour of the UK on 4 October 1968, still billed as the New Yardbirds; they
              played their first
              show as Led Zeppelin at the University of Surrey in Battersea on 25 October. Tour manager Richard Cole,
              who would
              become a major figure in the touring life of the group, organised their first North American tour at the
              end of the
              year. Their debut album, Led Zeppelin, was released in the US during the tour on 12 January 1969 and
              peaked at
              number 10 on the Billboard chart; it was released in the UK, where it peaked at number 6, on 31 March.
              According
              to Steve Erlewine, the album's memorable guitar riffs, lumbering rhythms, psychedelic blues, groovy,
              bluesy shuffles and
              hints of English folk music made it "a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy
              metal".</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/earlyzep2.jpg" alt="zeppelin">
              <img src="/images/earlyzep4.jpg" alt="zeppy">
            </div>
            <p>In their first year Led Zeppelin completed four US and four UK concert tours, and also released their
              second album, Led
              Zeppelin II. Recorded mostly on the road at various North American studios, it was an even greater
              commercial success
              than their first album, and reached the number one chart position in the US and the UK. The album further
              developed
              the mostly blues-rock musical style established on their debut release, creating a sound that was "heavy
              and hard,
              brutal and direct", and which would be highly influential and frequently imitated. Steve Waksman has
              suggested that
              Led Zeppelin II was "the musical starting point for heavy metal".</p>
            <p>The band saw their albums as indivisible, complete listening experiences, disliking the re-editing of
              existing tracks
              for release as singles. Grant maintained an aggressive pro-album stance, particularly in the UK, where
              there were few
              radio and TV outlets for rock music. Without the band's consent, however, some songs were released as
              singles,
              particularly in the US. In 1969 an edited version of "Whole Lotta Love", a track from their second album,
              was
              released as a single in the US. It reached number four in the Billboard chart in January 1970, selling
              over one million
              copies and helping to cement the band's popularity. The group also increasingly shunned television
              appearances,
              citing their preference that their fans hear and see them in live concerts.</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/earlyzep3.jpg" alt="zeppelin">
              <img src="/images/earlyzep7.jpg" alt="zeppy">
            </div>
            <p>Following the release of their second album, Led Zeppelin completed several more US tours. They played
              initially in
              clubs and ballrooms, and then in larger auditoriums as their popularity grew. Some early Led Zeppelin
              concerts lasted
              more than four hours, with expanded and improvised live versions of their repertoire. Many of these shows
              have been
              preserved as bootleg recordings. It was during this period of intensive concert touring that the band
              developed a
              reputation for off-stage excess.</p>
            <p>In 1970, Page and Plant retired to Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote cottage in Wales, to commence work on their
              third album, Led
              Zeppelin III. The result was a more acoustic style that was strongly influenced by folk and Celtic music,
              and
              showcased the band's versatility. The album's rich acoustic sound initially received mixed reactions, with
              critics and
              fans surprised at the turn from the primarily electric arrangements of the first two albums, further
              fuelling the band's
              hostility to the musical press. It reached number one in the UK and US charts, but its stay would be the
              shortest of
              their first five albums. The album's opening track, "Immigrant Song", was released as a US single in
              November 1970
              against the band's wishes, reaching the top twenty on the Billboard chart.</p>

            <h3>"The Biggest Band in the World" : 1971 - 1975</h3>
            <p>During the 1970s, Led Zeppelin reached new heights of commercial and critical success that made them one
              of the most
              influential groups of the era, eclipsing their earlier achievements. The band's image also changed as the
              members began to wear elaborate, flamboyant clothing, with Page taking the lead on the flamboyant
              appearance by wearing
              a glittering moon-and-stars outfit. Led Zeppelin changed their show by using things such as lasers,
              professional light
              shows and mirror balls. They began travelling in a private jet airliner, a Boeing 720 (nicknamed the
              Starship),
              rented out entire sections of hotels (including the Continental Hyatt House in Los Angeles, known
              colloquially as the
              "Riot House"), and became the subject of frequently repeated stories of debauchery. One involved John
              Bonham riding a
              motorcycle through a rented floor of the Riot House, while another involved the destruction of a room in
              the Tokyo
              Hilton, leading to the group being banned from that establishment for life. Although Led Zeppelin
              developed a
              reputation for trashing their hotel suites and throwing television sets out of the windows, some suggest
              that these
              tales have been exaggerated. According to music journalist Chris Welch, "[Led Zeppelin's] travels spawned
              many stories,
              but it was a myth that [they] were constantly engaged in acts of wanton destruction and lewd behaviour".

            </div>
            <p>Led Zeppelin released their fourth album on 8 November 1971. It is variously referred to as Led Zeppelin
              IV, Untitled,
              IV, or, due to the four symbols appearing on the record label, as Four Symbols, Zoso or Runes. The band
              had wanted
              to release the fourth album with no title or information, in response to the music press "going on about
              Zeppelin being
              a hype", but the record company wanted something on the cover, so in discussions it was agreed to have
              four symbols to
              represent both the four members of the band, and that it was the fourth album. With 37 million copies
              sold, Led
              Zeppelin IV is one of the best-selling albums in history, and its massive popularity cemented Led
              Zeppelin's status as
              superstars in the 1970s. By 2006, it had sold 23 million copies in the United States alone. The track
              "Stairway to Heaven", never released as a single, was the most requested and most played song on American
              rock radio in
              the 1970s. The group followed up the album's release with tours of the UK, Australasia, North America,
              Japan, and
              the UK again from late 1971 through early 1973.</p>
            <p>Led Zeppelin's next album, Houses of the Holy, was released in March 1973. It featured further
              experimentation by the
              band, who expanded their use of synthesisers and mellotron orchestration. The predominantly orange album
              cover, designed
              by the London-based design group Hipgnosis, depicts images of nude children climbing the Giant's Causeway
              in Northern
              Ireland. Although the children are not shown from the front, the cover was controversial at the time of
              the album's
              release. As with the band's fourth album, neither their name nor the album title was printed on the
              sleeve.</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/page1.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Houses of the Holy topped charts worldwide, and the band's subsequent concert tour of North America in
              1973 broke
              records for attendance, as they consistently filled large auditoriums and stadiums. At Tampa Stadium in
              Florida, they
              played to 56,800 fans, breaking the record set by the Beatles' 1965 Shea Stadium concert and grossing
              $309,000.
              Three sold-out shows at Madison Square Garden in New York City were filmed for a motion picture, but the
              theatrical
              release of this project (The Song Remains the Same) was delayed until 1976. Before the final night's
              performance,
              $180,000 ($1,037,000 today) of the band's money from gate receipts was stolen from a safe deposit box at
              the Drake
              Hotel.</p>
            <p>In 1974, Led Zeppelin took a break from touring and launched their own record label, Swan Song, named
              after an
              unreleased song. The record label's logo is based on a drawing called Evening: Fall of Day (1869) by
              William Rimmer. The
              drawing features a figure of a winged human-like being interpreted as either Apollo or Icarus. The logo
              can
              be found on Led Zeppelin memorabilia, especially T-shirts. In addition to using Swan Song as a vehicle to
              promote their
              own albums, the band expanded the label's roster, signing artists such as Bad Company, the Pretty Things
              and Maggie
              Bell. The label was successful while Led Zeppelin existed, but folded less than three years after they
              disbanded.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In 1975, Led Zeppelin's double album Physical Graffiti was their first release on the Swan Song label. It
              consisted of
              fifteen songs, of which eight had been recorded at Headley Grange in 1974 and seven had been recorded
              earlier. A review
              in Rolling Stone magazine referred to Physical Graffiti as Led Zeppelin's "bid for artistic
              respectability", adding that
              the only bands Led Zeppelin had to compete with for the title "The World's Best Rock Band" were the
              Rolling Stones and
              the Who. The album was a massive commercial and critical success. Shortly after the release of Physical
              Graffiti,
              all previous Led Zeppelin albums simultaneously re-entered the top-200 album chart, and the band embarked
              on another
              North American tour, now employing sophisticated sound and lighting systems. In May 1975, Led Zeppelin
              played
              five sold-out nights at the Earls Court Arena in London, at the time the largest arena in Britain.</p>

            <h3>Hiatus from touring and return: 1975 - 1977</h3>
            <p>Following their triumphant Earls Court appearances, Led Zeppelin took a holiday and planned an autumn
              tour in America,
              scheduled to open with two outdoor dates in San Francisco. In August 1975, however, Plant and his wife
              Maureen were
              involved in a serious car crash while on holiday in Rhodes, Greece. Plant suffered a broken ankle and
              Maureen was badly
              injured; a blood transfusion saved her life. Unable to tour, he headed to the Channel Island of Jersey to
              spend
              August and September recuperating, with Bonham and Page in tow. The band then reconvened in Malibu,
              California. During
              this forced hiatus much of the material for their next album, Presence, was written.</p>
            <p>By this time, Led Zeppelin were the world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the
              time,
              including the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked a change in the Led Zeppelin sound
              towards
              more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements
              featured on
              their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among fans and
              the music
              press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun
              using
              heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live
              shows and studio
              recordings, although he has since denied this.</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/ledzepposter.jpeg" alt="">
              <img src="/images/ledzeplive13.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Because of Plant's injuries, Led Zeppelin did not tour in 1976. Instead, the band completed the concert
              film The Song
              Remains the Same and the accompanying soundtrack album. The film premiered in New York City on 20 October
              1976, but was
              given a lukewarm reception by critics and fans. The film was particularly unsuccessful in the UK, where,
              unwilling to
              tour since 1975 because of their tax exile status, Led Zeppelin faced an uphill battle to recapture the
              public's
              affection.</p>
            <p>In 1977, Led Zeppelin embarked on another major concert tour of North America. The band set another
              attendance record,
              with an audience of 76,229 at their Silverdome concert on 30 April. It was, according to the Guinness Book
              of
              Records, the largest attendance to that date for a single act show. Although the tour was financially
              profitable, it
              was beset by off-stage problems. On 19 April, over 70 people were arrested as about 1,000 fans tried to
              gatecrash
              Cincinnati Riverfront Coliseum for two sold-out concerts, while others tried to gain entry by throwing
              rocks and bottles
              through glass doors. On 3 June, a concert at Tampa Stadium was cut short because of a severe thunderstorm,
              despite
              tickets indicating "Rain or Shine". A riot broke out, resulting in arrests and injuries.</p>

              <img src="/images/bonham3.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>After 23 July show at the Day on the Green festival at the Oakland Coliseum in Oakland, California,
              Bonham and members
              of Led Zeppelin's support staff were arrested after a member of promoter Bill Graham's staff was badly
              beaten during the
              band's performance. The following day's second Oakland concert was the group's final live appearance in
              the
              United States. Two days later, as they checked in at a French Quarter hotel for their 30 July performance
              at the
              Louisiana Superdome, Plant received news that his five-year-old son, Karac, had died from a stomach virus.
              The rest of
              the tour was immediately cancelled, prompting widespread speculation about Led Zeppelin's future.</p>

            <h3>Bonham's death and breakup: 1978 - 1980</h3>
            <p>In November 1978, the group recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. The resulting album, In
              Through the Out
              Door, featured sonic experimentation that again drew mixed reactions from critics. Nevertheless, the album
              reached
              number one in the UK and the US in just its second week of release. With this album's release, Led
              Zeppelin's entire
              catalogue returned to the Billboard Top 200 in the weeks of 27 October and 3 November 1979.</p>
            <p>In August 1979, after two warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the
              Knebworth Music
              Festival, playing to a crowd of approximately 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour
              was
              undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy jams and solos.
              On 27 June, at
              a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert came to an abrupt halt in the middle of the third song, when
              Bonham collapsed
              onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the
              result of
              excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.</p>
            <p>A North American tour, the band's first since 1977, was scheduled to commence on 17 October 1980. On 24
              September,
              Bonham was picked up by Led Zeppelin assistant Rex King to attend rehearsals at Bray Studios. During the
              journey,
              Bonham asked to stop for breakfast, where he downed four quadruple vodkas (from 16 to 24 US fl oz (470 to
              710 ml)), with
              a ham roll. After taking a bite of the ham roll he said to his assistant, "breakfast". He continued to
              drink heavily
              after arriving at the studio. The rehearsals were halted late that evening and the band retired to Page's
              house—the Old
              Mill House in Clewer, Windsor.</p>
            <p>After midnight, Bonham, who had fallen asleep, was taken to bed and placed on his side. At 1:45 pm the
              next day, Benji
              LeFevre (Led Zeppelin's new tour manager) and John Paul Jones found Bonham dead. The cause of death was
              asphyxiation
              from vomit; the finding was accidental death. An autopsy found no other recreational drugs in Bonham's
              body.
              Although he had recently begun to take Motival (a cocktail of the antipsychotic fluphenazine and the
              tricyclic
              antidepressant nortriptyline) to combat his anxiety, it is unclear if these substances interacted with the
              alcohol in
              his system. Bonham's remains were cremated and his ashes interred on 12 October 1980, at Rushock parish
              church,
              Worcestershire.</p>

            <p>The planned North American tour was cancelled, and despite rumours that Cozy Powell, Carmine Appice,
              Barriemore Barlow,
              Simon Kirke, or Bev Bevan would join the group as his replacement, the remaining members decided to
              disband. A 4
              December 1980 press statement stated that, "We wish it to be known that the loss of our dear friend, and
              the deep sense
              of undivided harmony felt by ourselves and our manager, have led us to decide that we could not continue
              as we
              were." The statement was signed simply "Led Zeppelin".</p>
            <div class="bio-img">

            </div>
            <h3>Post-breakup: 1980s</h3>
            <p>Following Zeppelin's dissolution, the first significant project for the members was the Honeydrippers,
              which Plant
              initially formed in 1981, and which released its only album in 1984. The group featured Page on lead
              guitar, along with
              studio musicians and friends of the pair, including Jeff Beck, Paul Shaffer, and Nile Rodgers. Plant
              focused on a
              different direction from Zeppelin, playing standards and in a more R&B style, highlighted by a cover of
              "Sea of Love"
              that peaked at number three on the Billboard chart in early 1985.</p>
            <p>Coda – a collection of Zeppelin outtakes and unused tracks – was issued in November 1982. It included two
              tracks from
              the Royal Albert Hall in 1970, one each from the Led Zeppelin III and Houses of the Holy sessions, and
              three from the In
              Through the Out Door sessions. It also featured a 1976 Bonham drum instrumental with electronic effects
              added by Page,
              called "Bonzo's Montreux".</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/ledzep_liveaid.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>On 13 July 1985, Page, Plant, and Jones reunited for the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia,
              playing a short
              set featuring drummers Tony Thompson and Phil Collins, and bassist Paul Martinez. Collins had contributed
              to Plant's
              first two solo albums while Martinez was a member of Plant's solo band. The performance was marred by a
              lack of
              rehearsal with the two drummers, Page's struggles with an out-of-tune guitar, poorly functioning monitors,
              and Plant's
              hoarse voice. Page described the performance as "pretty shambolic", while Plant characterised it as an
              "atrocity".</p>
            <p>The three members reunited again on 14 May 1988, for the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert, with
              Bonham's son
              Jason on drums. The result was again disjointed: Plant and Page had argued immediately prior to taking the
              stage about
              whether to play "Stairway to Heaven", and Jones' keyboards were absent from the live television feed. Page
              described the performance as "one big disappointment" and Plant said "the gig was foul".</p>
            <h3>1990s</h3>
            <p>The first Led Zeppelin box set, featuring tracks remastered under Page's supervision, was released in
              1990 and bolstered
              the band's reputation, leading to abortive discussions among members about a reunion. This set included
              four
              previously unreleased tracks, including a version of Robert Johnson's "Travelling Riverside Blues". The
              song peaked
              at number seven on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart.[96] Led Zeppelin Boxed Set 2 was released in
              1993; the two box
              sets together contained all known studio recordings, as well as some rare live tracks.</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/ledzepboxset1.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>In 1994, Page and Plant reunited for a 90-minute "UnLedded" MTV project. They later released an album
              called No Quarter:
              Jimmy Page and Robert Plant Unledded, which featured some reworked Led Zeppelin songs, and embarked on a
              world tour the
              following year. This is said to be the beginning of a rift between the band members, as Jones was not even
              told of the
              reunion.</p>
            <p>In 1995, Led Zeppelin were inducted into the United States Rock and Roll Hall of Fame by Steven Tyler and
              Joe Perry of
              Aerosmith. Jason and Zoë Bonham also attended, representing their late father. At the induction ceremony,
              the band's
              inner rift became apparent when Jones joked upon accepting his award, "Thank you, my friends, for finally
              remembering my
              phone number", causing consternation and awkward looks from Page and Plant. Afterwards, they played one
              brief set
              with Tyler and Perry, with Jason Bonham on drums, and then a second with Neil Young, this time with
              Michael Lee playing
              the drums.</p>
            <p>In 1997, Atlantic released a single edit of "Whole Lotta Love" in the US and the UK, the only single the
              band released
              in their homeland, where it peaked at number 21. November 1997 saw the release of Led Zeppelin BBC
              Sessions, a
              two-disc set largely recorded in 1969 and 1971. Page and Plant released another album called Walking into
              Clarksdale in 1998, featuring all new material, but after disappointing sales, the partnership dissolved
              before a
              planned Australian tour.</p>

            </div>
            <h3>2000s</h3>
            <p>2003 saw the release of the triple live album How the West Was Won, and Led Zeppelin DVD, a six-hour
              chronological set
              of live footage that became the best-selling music DVD in history. In July 2007, Atlantic/Rhino and Warner
              Home
              Video announced three Zeppelin titles to be released that November: Mothership, a 24-track best-of
              spanning the band's
              career; a reissue of the soundtrack The Song Remains the Same, including previously unreleased material;
              and a new
              DVD. Zeppelin also made their catalogue legally available for download, becoming one of the last major
              rock
              bands to do so.</p>
            <p>On 10 December 2007, Zeppelin reunited for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert at the O2 Arena in London,
              with Jason
              Bonham again taking his father's place on drums. According to Guinness World Records 2009, the show set a
              record for the
              "Highest Demand for Tickets for One Music Concert" as 20 million requests were submitted online. Critics
              praised
              the performance and there was widespread speculation about a full reunion. Page, Jones and Jason Bonham
              were
              reported to be willing to tour, and to be working on material for a new Zeppelin project. Plant continued
              his
              touring commitments with Alison Krauss, stating in September 2008 that he would not record or tour with
              the
              band. "I told them I was busy and they'd simply have to wait," he recalled in 2014. "I would come around
              eventually, which they were fine with – at least to my knowledge. But it turns out they weren't. And
              what's even more
              disheartening, Jimmy used it against me."</p>
            <div class="bio-img">
              <img src="/images/ledzep2007.jpg" alt="">
            </div>
            <p>Jones and Page reportedly looked for a replacement for Plant; candidates including Steven Tyler of
              Aerosmith, and Myles
              Kennedy of Alter Bridge. However, in January 2009, it was confirmed that the project had been abandoned.
              "Getting the opportunity to play with Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Jason Bonham was pretty special,"
              Kennedy
              recalled. "That is pretty much the zenith right there. That was a crazy, good experience. It's something I
              still think
              of often ... It's so precious to me."</p>
            <h3>2010s and beyond</h3>
            <p>A film of the O2 performance, Celebration Day, premiered on 17 October 2012 and was released on DVD on 19
              November.
              The film grossed $2 million in one night, and the live album peaked at number 4 and 9 in the UK and US,
              respectively. Following the film's premiere, Page revealed that he had been remastering the band's
              discography. The first wave of albums, Led Zeppelin, Led Zeppelin II, and Led Zeppelin III, were released
              on 2 June
              2014. The second wave of albums, Led Zeppelin IV and Houses of the Holy, were released on 27 October 2014.
              Physical Graffiti was released on 23 February 2015, almost exactly forty years to the day after the
              original
              release. The fourth and final wave of studio album reissues, Presence, In Through the Out Door, and Coda,
              were
              released on 31 July 2015.</p>
            <p>Through this remastering project, each studio album was reissued on CD and vinyl and was also available
              in a Deluxe
              Edition, which contained a bonus disc of previously unheard material (Coda's Deluxe Edition would include
              two bonus
              discs). Each album was also available in a Super Deluxe Edition Box Set, which included the remastered
              album and bonus
              disc on both CD and 180-gram vinyl, a high-definition audio download card of all content at 96 kHz/24 bit,
              a hard bound
              book filled with rare and previously unseen photos and memorabilia, and a high quality print of the
              original album
              cover.</p>

            <p>On 6 November 2015, the Mothership compilation was reissued using the band's newly remastered audio
              tracks. The
              reissuing campaign continued the next year with the re-release of BBC Sessions on 16 September 2016. The
              reissue
              contained a bonus disc with nine unreleased BBC recordings, including the heavily bootlegged but never
              officially
              released "Sunshine Woman".</p>
            <p>To commemorate the band's 50th anniversary, Page, Plant and Jones announced an official illustrated book
              celebrating 50
              years since the formation of the band. Also released for the celebration was a reissue of How the West Was
              Won on
              23 March 2018, which includes the album's first pressing on vinyl. For Record Store Day on 21 April 2018,
              Led
              Zeppelin released a 7" single "Rock and Roll" (Sunset Sound Mix)/"Friends" (Olympic Studio Mix), their
              first single in
              21 years.</p>

          <h2>Legacy</h2>
          <p>Many have considered Led Zeppelin to be one of the most successful, innovative, and influential bands in
            the history of
            rock music. Rock critic Mikal Gilmore said, "Led Zeppelin—talented, complex, grasping, beautiful and
            dangerous—made
            one of the most enduring bodies of composition and performance in twentieth-century music, despite
            everything they had
            to overpower, including themselves".</p>
          <p>Led Zeppelin have influenced hard rock and heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Rush,
            Queen, Aerosmith, the Black Crowes, and Megadeth as well as progressive metal bands like Tool
            and Dream Theater. They influenced some early punk and post-punk bands, among them the Ramones, Joy
            Division and the Cult. They were also an important influence on the development of alternative rock, as
            bands adapted elements from the "Zeppelin sound" of the mid-1970s, including the Smashing Pumpkins,
            Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden. Bands and artists from diverse genres have acknowledged the
            influence of Led Zeppelin, such as Madonna, Shakira, Lady Gaga, Kesha, and Katie Melua.</p>
          <div class="bio-img">

          </div>
          <p>Led Zeppelin have been credited with a major impact on the nature of the music business, particularly in
            the development
            of album-orientated rock (AOR) and stadium rock. In 1988 John Kalodner, then-A&R executive of Geffen
            Records,
            remarked that "In my opinion, next to the Beatles they're the most influential band in history. They
            influence the way
            music is on records, AOR radio, concerts. They set the standards for the AOR-radio format with 'Stairway to
            Heaven,'
            having AOR hits without necessarily having Top 40 hits. They're the ones who did the first real big arena
            concert shows,
            consistently selling out and playing stadiums without support. People can do as well as them, but nobody
            surpasses
            them". Andrew Loog Oldham, the former producer and manager of the Rolling Stones, commented on how Led
            Zeppelin had
            a major influence on the record business, and the way rock concerts were managed and presented to huge
            audiences.
            In 2007, they were a featured artist in the stadium rock episode of the BBC/VH1 series Seven Ages of Rock.
          </p>
          <p>The band have sold over 200 million albums worldwide according to some sources, while others state that
            they have
            sold in excess of 300 million records, including 111.5 million certified units in the United States.
            According to
            the Recording Industry Association of America, Led Zeppelin are the third-highest-selling band, the fifth
            highest
            selling music act in the US, and one of only four acts to earn five or more Diamond albums. They achieved
            eight
            consecutive number-ones on the UK Albums Chart, a record for most consecutive UK number-one albums shared
            with
            ABBA. Led Zeppelin remain one of the most bootlegged artists in the history of rock music.</p>
          <div class="bio-img">
            <img src="/images/zeppelinplatinum2.jpg" alt="img">
          </div>
          <p>Led Zeppelin also made a significant cultural impact. Jim Miller, editor of Rolling Stone Illustrated
            History of Rock &
            Roll, argues that "on one level, Led Zeppelin represents the final flowering of the sixties' psychedelic
            ethic, which
            casts rock as passive sensory involvement". Led Zeppelin have also been described as "the quintessential
            purveyors" of masculine and aggressive "cock rock", although this assertion has been challenged. The band's
            fashion-sense has been seminal; Simeon Lipman, head of pop culture at Christie's auction house, has
            commented that "Led
            Zeppelin have had a big influence on fashion because the whole aura surrounding them is so cool, and people
            want a piece
            of that". Led Zeppelin laid the foundation for the big hair of 1980s glam metal bands such as Mötley Crüe
            and Skid
            Row. Other musicians have also adapted elements from Led Zeppelin's attitude to clothes, jewellery and hair,
            such
            as the hipster flares and tight band T-shirts of Kings of Leon, shaggy hair, clingy T-shirts and bluesman
            hair of Jack
            White of the White Stripes, and Kasabian guitarist Sergio Pizzorno's silk scarves, trilbies and side-laced
            tight
            jeans.</p>
          <h2>Achievements</h2>
          <p>Led Zeppelin have collected many honours and awards throughout the course of their career. They were
            inducted into the
            Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, and the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006. Among the band's awards are an
            American Music Award in 2005, and the Polar Music Prize in 2006. Led Zeppelin were the recipient of a Grammy
            Lifetime Achievement Award in 2005, and four of their recordings have been inducted into the Grammy Hall of
            Fame. They have been awarded five Diamond albums, as well as fourteen Multi-Platinum, four Platinum and one
            Gold
            album in the United States, while in the UK they have five Multi-Platinum, six Platinum, one Gold and four
            Silver
            albums. In addition to listing five of their albums among "the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time", Rolling
            Stone
            named Led Zeppelin the 14th-greatest artist of all time in 2004.</p>
          <p>In 2005, Page was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in recognition of his charity
            work, and in
            2009 Plant was honoured as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for his services to popular music.
            The
            band are ranked number one on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock and Classic Rock's "50 best live acts
            of all
            time". They were named as the best Rock band in a poll by BBC Radio 2. They were awarded an Ivor Novello
            Award
            for "Outstanding Contribution to British Music" in 1977, as well as a "Lifetime Achievement Award" at the
            42nd
            Annual Ivor Novello awards ceremony in 1997. The band were honoured at the 2008 MOJO Awards with the "Best
            Live
            Act" prize for their one-off reunion, and were described as the "greatest rock and roll band of all time".
            Led
            Zeppelin were named as 2012 recipients of the Kennedy Center Honors.</p>
